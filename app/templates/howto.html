     Navigate to a track page. All layers can be muted, whether or not you are logged in. To <i> Delete Layer </i>, if you are the owner of the track, you can delete any layer associated with the track. If you are not the creator of the track, you can only delete your own layers. In the following example, since the track creator is "Noah Zweben", and I am logged in as itchynose27, I am only able to delete the <i>low chorus harmony</i> layer because I recorded it. This feature ensures that the original creator of a track has the final say on the harmonies included in the track.<br>
